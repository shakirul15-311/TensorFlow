# TensorFlow


TensorFlow is a powerful open source software library. It was developed by the Google Brain team in 2012 for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache License 2.0 on November 9, 2015.


TensorFlow is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. Its basic principle is simple: you first define in Python a graph of computations to perform (for example, the one in Fig 2.1), and then TensorFlow takes that graph and runs it efficiently using optimized C++ code.
